### Question 1: Your takeaways from the video

1. Design habits for the behaviour to achieve the outcome, not the outcome itself
2. Have tiny habits which are designed to achieve an outcome. They take root in your system and compound the effect you put in to achieve the outcome
3. To create a habit, one requires motivation, ability and a trigger
4. Triggers can also have a cascading behaviour. Old behaviours can be used to trigger new behaviours
5. After I [existing habit], I will [new tiny behaviour]

### Question 5: Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

There are four stages of Habit Formation

1. Noticing
2. Wanting
3. Doing
4. Liking



You can't take an action if you don't notice something

* Implementation Action
    * Have the plan to implement the behaviour
    * Having clarity, and motivation without clarity of plan does nothing

* If you notice something, you should be 'wanting' to take an action on it

    * Design your environment to drive you towards achieving your habit

        * You want to read a book before bed? Keep the book on the pillow.

    * Make bad habits harder to achieve and good habits easier to achieve

* Learning how to start doing things is important

    * Two-minute rule:

        * If it takes two minutes, do it now
        * Any habit can be started in less than two minutes
        * Optimise for the beginning of the task
    * Best way to change long-term behaviour is with short-term feedback
    * Don't break the chain and never miss twice

* Like what you do

* If you can change your habits, you can change your life
