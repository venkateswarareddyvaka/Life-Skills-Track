## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique
---

### Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique?
This technique is named after a great scientist "Richard p.feymam".

Richard Feynman has a nickname called "The Great Explainer".

1. when we work on a big code we have to break it down into small pieces until we understand.

2. Explaining a concept helps to improve our basic understanding of the concept.

3. The first principle is that we must not fool ourselves.

4. Take a piece of paper, and list the concepts.

### Question 2:What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?

1. Explain the topic.
2. Take a piece of paper and write Concepts.
3. Think like you are explaining it to a child.
4. Explain it in simple language and with basic examples.
5. Identify problem areas, where you are struggling to explain.
6. pinpoint any complicated terms and challenge ourselves to simplify them.

### Question 3: Paraphrase the video in detail in your own words.
1. In these we learn how to improve our learning skills.
2. How did we learn, and tell them in an effective to learn others?
3. when we trying to solve a problem, and we got stuck, we want to leave that problem, and allow them to do it in diffuse mode(rest mode).
4. simply, sit alone and relaxed thinking about the situation, key an object near us that makes us not fall asleep.

### Question 4: What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?
1. we have to focus on what we are learning.
2. we have to think differently, the diffuse mode will help us, diffuse having a clean and thinking about a topic.
3. when we trying to solve a problem, and we got stuck, we want to leave that problem, and allow them to do it in diffuse mode(rest mode) & then think about it.
4. when we got ideas in diffused mode(rest mode). Apply them immediately and check them.
5. Use the Pomodoro technique: It is a time management technique, set a timer, and kept all your distractions aside (mobiles).
6. keep concentrating on the topic during this topic, once it's done get some fun. (like chatting, watching reels, etc.).
7. Don't compare with any ones else.
8. Exercising daily will help us the ability, to both learn and remember.

This helps us effective learning and increases our focusing mode.

### Question 5:Your key takeaways from the video?
1. practicing a lot, will make us perfect.
2. By practicing a particular thing we became better and better.
3. practicing will also help us to improve our ability to learn quickly and efficiently.
4. If we put focus on 20 hours of learning and practicing, it helps us to improve. 
5. practice improves our performance.

### Question 6: What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?
1. Deconstruct the programming language: Break the code into basics thing(datatypes, loops, arrays, objects), etc.
2. learn Enough to self-correct: study over three or more documents about the topic.
3. Remove practice barriers: keeping the distracting things away(mobiles) while learning things.
4. Practising for 20 Hours: Don't hesitate to practice, in the initial it is a little bit confusing, but by practicing we become experts.
